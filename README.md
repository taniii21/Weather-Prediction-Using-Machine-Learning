# Weather-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This study investigates the application of machine learning for predicting weather parameters. By utilising historical weather datasets, ML algorithms can be trained to predict future conditions. The process begins with data collections.Preprocessing techniques are applied , ensuring it is suitable for training machine learning models.
